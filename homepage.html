Create a futuristic, premium homepage (dashboard) in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).

Theme:
- Dark futuristic background (deep gradient or subtle neural grid)
- Soft glow effects
- Smooth animations
- Premium, clean startup aesthetic
- No AI hype, focused on entrepreneurship

Layout Requirements:

1. Main Content:
- Display FIVE large circular bubbles in the center of the screen.
- Each bubble represents a session:
  1. Foundation
  2. Strategy
  3. Execution
  4. Scaling
  5. Leadership

- Bubbles should:
  - Have soft neon glow
  - Slight floating animation
  - Smooth hover effect (scale + glow)
  - Be arranged in an elegant layout (zigzag or curved path preferred)

2. Bottom Navigation:
- Fixed bottom navigation bar (minimal, glassmorphism style).
- Three icons only:

  - Center: Home icon (active state highlighted)
  - Left of Home: Progression icon
  - Right of Home: Profile icon

- Icons should:
  - Glow softly when active
  - Animate slightly when clicked
  - Be evenly spaced and centered at bottom
  - Minimal labels below icons

3. Interaction:
- Clicking each bubble should link to:
  session1.html
  session2.html
  session3.html
  session4.html
  session5.html

- Clicking:
  - Home → homepage.html
  - Progress → progress.html
  - Profile → profile.html

4. Animation:
- Page loads with smooth fade-in
- Bubbles animate in one by one
- Subtle floating effect (very soft)

5. Responsive:
- Works perfectly on mobile and desktop
- Bubbles stack nicely on smaller screens
- Bottom nav always stays fixed

6. Code Requirements:
- All code inside a single file: homepage.html
- Internal CSS and JS
- Clean, well-commented code
- No external libraries

Make it feel like a billion-dollar startup founder academy.
Clean. Confident. Futuristic. Not flashy.
